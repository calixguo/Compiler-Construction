All my code about Local Value Numbering and Loop Unrolling are implemented in C++
under code.h, code.cc

How to build my lab:
	First, run make clean
	Then, run make

How to run my lab:
	then you do ./code + v/l/b + YOUR_INPUT_FILENAME
	
	choose one from v, l and b
		v stands for value numbering
		l stands for looping unrolling
		b stands for both
	
	It should generate a file named output4.i
	Use output4.i as input for Sim
	Go to Sim Folder
	Copy output4.i contents into output.i
	run ./sim output.i + test files 
	
	check your cycles now.
