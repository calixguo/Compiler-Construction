qsort

This simple code implements a non-recursive quicksort.
It prints out the sorted list.  (Hence, you don't want 
to run this on a 10,000 number file.) 

This version does not correctly handle a file that contains
duplicate entries.
 
  qsort.i  -- the code
  qsort1.d -- an input file with 20 numbers in worst case order
  qsortl2.d -- an input file with 40 numbers in an average kind of order
